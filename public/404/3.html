      Once Ralph is appointed as the chief of the groups, he establishes two
      main priorities: Rescue and shelter. However, Jack ignores Ralph’s
      priorities to fuel his bloodthirst. First, when Ralph and Simon recall the
      meeting saying “’ Remember how everyone was to work hard until the shelter
      was finished?’” (Golding, 35), Jack responds “’ Except me and my
      hunters.’” (Golding, 35). Jack isn’t concerned about the group, instead,
      he is selfish by feeding his bloodthirst through hunting expressed in the
      first chapter: “’ Next time there will be no mercy.’” (Golding, 20).
      Secondly, Jack is completely ignorant of the main priority of everyone on
      this island: Rescue. Jack had been so consumed in feeding his bloodthirst
      he has already adapted to the island. “Jack had to think for a moment
      before he could remember what rescue was.” (Golding,37). Once Jack
      remembers rescue, he insanely says “’ Rescue? Yes, of course! All the
      same, I’d like to catch a pig first’” (Golding, 38), which shows Jack is
      losing touch with his normal self, transforming into a savage. Due to this
      metamorphosis, Jack has no interest in the group’s welfare because of his
      evolution to savagery.

      On the island, most of the children run off into panic searching for a way
      to get rescued or ignore the situation they are in. However, Simon is an
      exception, comparing the way he and the other boys react to the island.
      Furthermore, Simon is the only one who respects the island and
      acknowledges that the island has all they need to survive. We see a
      glimpse of his uniqueness in chapter one: “’ Like candles. Candle bushes.
      Candle buds.’” (Golding, 20). Later in chapter 3, Simon has disappeared
      from the group finding sanctuary in another place with all his basic
      needs. Therefore, Simon can help others because of his security being
      established, for example, “Simon found for them the fruit they could not
      reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back to
      the endless, outstretched hands.” (Golding, 40). Simon could be seen as a
      God-like figure almost like Jesus the way he provides for the group of
      children. Simon has similarities to Jesus such as providence to people,
      selflessness, and his inevitable fate in the end
