      Simon, Jack and Ralph are the main characters introduced to the reader in
      the first chapter of the book. Simon is a rational thinker. Instead of
      panicking, Simon looks at the potential and magnificence of the island,
      respecting the island (Golding,20). Simon had not sought after dominance
      over the group but looked to help others in the upcoming chapters in a
      sustainable way. On the other hand, Ralph and Jack are rather the opposite
      of Simon’s reactions and interpretations of the island. Both are fighting
      to win the respect of the other children and neither respect the island
      the way Simon does. The first thing Jack and Ralph do is make a democracy
      and a group of hunters out of the choir. Another one of their ideas was to
      push a giant rock that could cause nothing but harm to the island, and
      themselves. Shortly after, the group lights the fire almost burning down
      the whole island. In conclusion, the main difference between Simon, and
      Ralph and Jack are their ideals: Simon thinking about the basic needs of
      food and sustainability on the island, and Ralph and Jack prioritize being
      rescued with no remorse to the resources or lives they could lose by
      burning down the island.

      During the first chapter, the boys are starting to get acquainted with the
      new island exploring finding plants, fruits, pigs, and many other things.
      As the chapter progressed, we see that the island is able to sustain life.
      Simon is one of the potential pieces of to find hospitality to the island
      because he observes the island, “Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle
      Buds.” (Golding, 20), “We could make scratches on the bark [to make some
      sort of map],” (Golding, 17) This appreciation of nature and attention to
      detail could enlighten the other boys to listen to him and possibly meet
      their basic needs until they are rescued. However, the leaders of the
      group: Ralph and Simon; have other ideas. One of their ideas was to push a
      giant rock down for their entertainment resulting in a “deep hole in the
      canopy of the forest. Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated,
      the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster,”
      (Golding, 18). In addition, Jack is a big threat to the hospitality of the
      island. Once the group had finished killing the pig for food “He took his
      knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk. ‘Next time there
      will be no mercy.’” (Golding, 20). This quote shows the blood-thirst of
      Jack and the possibility of him hunting for sport, putting the pigs on the
      island in danger. The island is hospitable, although the boys on the
      island may not know or care about the consequences of their actions
      towards the land which may result in bloodshed.
