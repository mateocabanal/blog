      When the group decides on a leader, there are two main candidates: Jack
      and Ralph. However, the two have different approaches and beliefs to
      leadership. Firstly, Jack uses the pigs as a resource, saying he wants to
      “hunt pigs to get meat for everybody.” (Golding,25). Additionally, Jack
      manipulates the fear of the children to form fake protection through
      statements and actions: “Jack slammed his knife into a trunk and looked
      round challengingly.” (Golding, 21). Jack also promises that if there were
      a snake, they would kill it. “But there isn’t a snake-thing. But if there
      was a snake, we’d hunt it and kill it.” (Golding, 25). On the other hand,
      Ralph uses a people-pleasing way of leadership, almost like the
      politicians of today’s world. Ralph uses the fear in an assuring way to
      the children declaring that “we shall be rescued.” (Golding, 25), without
      any hard evidence to back up his statement. Instead of providing any valid
      evidence, he exclaims that “[His] father is in the navy. He said that all
      islands have been discovered and sooner or later a ship will put in here.”
      without knowing anything himself. Ralph uses his authority and influences
      the children into them being rescued, ultimately bringing joy to the
      depressing situation.

      During the first chapter, there are four major forms of symbolism: the
      conch, piggy’s glasses, Jacks’ knife, and the signal fire. Firstly, the
      conch is a symbol of order and democracy on the island. Furthermore, the
      conch is delicate and calls the meetings representing democracy’s fragile
      nature and its tendency to fail. Secondly, Piggy’s glasses represent
      rationality within the group because of the glasses being able to light
      the fire, and piggy being the most intelligent one. Third, Jack’s knife
      may represent bloodlust and savagery towards the island. To add on, the
      knife is repeatedly stabbed into multiple trees which may foreshadow the
      boy’s lack of respect towards the island. Lastly, the signal fire
      represents their connection to civilization. The more the fire is lit in
      the later chapters the more civilized and inclined they are to being
      rescued, and when the fire is not lit the boys are savage and are
      disconnected from reality.
